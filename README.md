# pexpect.py
Pexpect python 3 example

Just a simple example to execute more than 1 command on remote an log in a local file
the host and password are hardcoded but you can import sys module to insert the host and password
although this is just a simple script this can be converted in a function be called from a bigger script

TODO:
- Add the line when ask "...want to add the key..."
- test on an environment with shared key (without ask for password)
